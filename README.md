# Data-Exploration-Project-Econometrics
Data Exploration Project for Econometrics; Dr. Huntington-Klein; WQ22

This is the repo for my Data Exploration Project. Project was assigned as part of my Econometrics class in Winter of 2022.
The Raw Data folder contains all data used for this analysis.
The R Code folder contains an R Markdown file with all code and a knitted html file.
